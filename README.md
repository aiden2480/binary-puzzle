## :bar_chart: Details
Aiden Gardner 11SDD6 Year 11 Term 2 BinaryPuzzle assessment 2021.
Solves 6x6 binary puzzles using three rules. Available in HTML and Python.

## :scroll: Licence
This project is licensed under the [MIT licence](https://choosealicense.com/licenses/mit/#). For more info, see the group project [Wiki page](https://github.com/aiden2480/A2-UniTech-BinaryPuzzle/wiki#justification-of-licence).

## :snake: Python
The Python version is located under [`python/`](./python) and should be accessed via `cd python` before running `main.py` (due to relative imports).
Dependencies may be installed through `pip install -r requirements.txt`. `Colorama` module is optional.
An executable file is automatically created on each push, though it doesn't have colorama support enabled.

If the program displays a bunch of replacement characters (ï¿½) instead of displaying a title, use the `--no-title` flag. If you want to disable terminal colours (:confused:) pass the `--no-colour` flag
