## :snake: Python
The Python version is located under [`python/`](./python) and should be accessed via `cd python` before running `main.py` (due to relative imports)
Dependencies may be installed through `pip install -r requirements.txt`. `Colorama` module is optional.
An executable file is automatically created on each push, though it doesn't have colorama support enabled.
